# We Each Have Goals, Hopes, and Desires

## Community of Practice for Social Creatives

---

Hey COPers,

We each have goals, hopes, and desires.

This practice is intended to help us, help each other, put it all out there and stay the course.

**We show up for each other, and for ourselves, with kind accountability.**

**We trust in what's possible when we offer each other practical curiosity.**

**We share openly and honestly.**

**We ask the questions we most want to hear the answer to.**

---

To commit to a practice in this way, it takes a degree of vulnerability… it takes a degree of faith.

To move in the direction of our goals… is not easy. 

You know that. I know that. 

And that's why we keep showing up one week, one convo, one step at a time.

Love,
MCK

## As the Bouncer

### I Will Start With Clarity
When I take 2-3 mins to start with one clear sentence, I help myself and my Sounder to make the most of this convo.

### I Trust The Process
When I share my starting sentence and stop, I know this starting point is enough. My Sounder's curiosity will guide me from here.

### Curiosity is Valuable Currency
When I let my Sounder's curiosity guide me, I gain the clarity, insight, and action step I need to move in the direction of my goals. This is very valuable.

## As the Sounder

### My Curiosity is Rare and Valuable
We're taught to believe that we give 'value' when we give advice, suggestions, solutions, etc.

When I'm a great listener and ask the questions I most want to hear the answer to, this is rare and valuable for my Bouncer.

### I Trust The Process
When I trust the process, my Bouncer gains the clarity, insight, and action step they need to move in the direction of their goals.

### The 10 min Post-Bounce Buffer Gives Us a Little More Time
- Is there a resource you think your partner would benefit from?
- Do you have a perspective and/or feedback your partner might benefit from?
- Was there a question you didn't have time to ask?

*Ask for their interest / permission / consent first.*

## Weekly Calendar Invite Reminders

### STEP 1 – COP4SC Prep Questions [2-3 mins]

Slow down, clarify your first sentence, and get in the zone for your exchange. Take 2-3 mins for the COP4SC Prep Questions before your call.

*IF you don't have time beforehand, your partner will let you take 2-3 mins to slow down, clarify your first sentence, and get in the zone.*

### STEP 2 – Call via WhatsApp Group Thread

Please call each other on our WhatsApp Group thread (I promise, I won't pick up).

You're encouraged to take the call off camera from anywhere that allows you to be fully present for your partner and for yourself, easily heard, and without distracting noises.

### STEP 3 – Follow the Bounce Conversation Guide [20 + 10 x 2]

Follow the Bounce Conversation Guide for 20 mins. And remember the 10 mins Post-Bounce buffer time to further the exchange.

### STEP 4 – COP Post Questions [5-10 mins]

Build momentum by solidifying your key takeaways and next step via the COP4SC Post Questions after your call ends while it's still fresh in your mind.

**Happy Bounce'ing :)**
MCK
